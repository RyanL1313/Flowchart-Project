                            Focusing on gender as a fundamental category of meaning, the course will introduce methods and approaches to Women's and Gender Studies in a variety of disciplines, examining the pervasive and often unacknowledged ways that gender changes our social institutions, individual knowledge, and interpersonal relationships. The course includes guest lectures by many of our faculty teaching courses in the Women's and Gender Studies minor.<br/>
